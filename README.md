<h1> Vedika’s Experience with Dance! </h1>



<p> I have been dancing for almost 11 years now. To put that into perspective, I just turned 15, and started when I was just 4. My variety of experiences and opportunities I have gotten led me to where I am today. </p>



<p> Some of the greatest opportunities I have gotten are being my group’s dance lead this year, group dance captain last year. I have also been able to compete in dance competitions in my group, where we won 1st place about 5 times! </p>



<p> I have also been nominated for 2 awards throughout my division. My division is Advanced 2, with about 7 other groups. I was nominated for the awards “Most Improved” and “Best Overall Performance”, and won 1 of them! </p>



<h2> This is just a little recap of <strong> some </strong> of the most important moments in my dance career. </h2>
