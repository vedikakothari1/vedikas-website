    <h1> Vedika's Coding Experience! </h1>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p> Hello! My name is Vedika Kothari, and I am writing this at 10:40 AM on Thursday, October 1, 2020. I assume that the next time I look at this website is in 10 years from now for nostalgia, or for another AP CSPrinciples assignment. Either way, in this website I will go through a brief overview of the exposure I have gotten to computer science and coding. </p>
    <h2> 2019 </h2>
    <h3> UCI </h3>
    <p> I started coding in July of 2019 after attending a coding camp at the University of California, Irvine. This is where I got my first real passion for coding, and knew that this would be a good major to go into. For the first time, I was actually interested in something, so much that I thought about it being a pursuable career. </p>

   <h2> 2020 </h2>
   <h3> Volunteer Work + CS Club Cabinet </h3>
   <p> I started volunteering to teach young girls coding to further my own experience as well as teach others an important and valuable skill that is constantly growing in existence. Then, I decided to take a shot, and apply for CS Club Cabinet, and fortunately got chosen as the 2020-2021 CS Club Treasurer at Whitney High School! </p>
